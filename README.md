**Resume Screening using NLP in Python**

Designed and developed an automated resume screening system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to streamline the hiring process. The project extracts and processes resumes and job descriptions using libraries like **spaCy**, **NLTK**, and **scikit-learn**, applying text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal. Key candidate skills and experiences are matched against job requirements using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**, generating relevance scores to rank applicants. The system significantly reduces manual screening effort and improves hiring efficiency by identifying the most relevant candidates based on data-driven analysis.
